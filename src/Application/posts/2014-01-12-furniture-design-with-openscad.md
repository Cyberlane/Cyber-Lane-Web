description: Furniture I designed with OpenSCAD
---
In my last blog post I started to show off something I threw together in OpenSCAD in a few minutes, and I have been playing around with the application a bit more since then. So I had a rough idea in my head of some furniture I wanted to build to improve my bedroom, and since I haven't touched a CAD application in quite a while, doing it in code just makes sense to me.

Below you can see my updated code where I have basically made use of variables, modules, and colour. Personally, I found it very easy and straight forward to follow, however if anybody reading this is struggling to understand it and is genuinely interested, I would be more than happy to create another blog post in the near future explaining how it all works (essentially a tutorial).
