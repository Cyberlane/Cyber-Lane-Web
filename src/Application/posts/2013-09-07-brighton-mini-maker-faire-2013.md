I had a great time at the Brighton Mini Maker Faire today.

We unfortunately sold out of the Soldering Is Easy kits, and not everybody got to build one. I will however be making more of the flower badges, as well as a variety of others. Please contact me if you would like to purchase a kit. Unique kits, collaborative designs and customisations are available for bigger orders. Contact me for futher details.

I do my best to read all my emails and respond within the same day, however I am going away on vacation next week and most likely will not be able to respond to my emails until I return on Saturday the 14th of September, 2013.

I will be regularly updating this site with new projects and kits, so be sure to check back!
