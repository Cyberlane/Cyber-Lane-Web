Due to popular request, I have decided to add a mini blog to my website so I can keep people up to date with what I am working on! As and when I am working on new projects, or have something I feel is worth sharing with the world, I will be adding another post.

I am receiving another batch of the Soldering Is Easy badges in the next few days, and will put them up on here to sell for anybody interested in buying more to build at home. On a related note, I am also finalising some designs for a range of Christmas themed kits and should have all the details for those to ready to share in the next few days as well. Now to add to the excitement, I am planning to host a series of small workshops in Brighton in November and December! So if you would like to attend another fun workshop, or have some friends who feel they missed out on the one I had the Brighton Mini Maker Faire, these will be great for you all!

If you have any questions or want me to drop you an email to make sure you don't miss out, then feel free to contact me! My email address and twitter are both on my home page.
